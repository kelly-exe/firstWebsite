                        <h1>
                            Hello, Thanks for visiting my site.
                        </h1>
                        <p>Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
                            I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
                            She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
                            In the shape of an "L" on her forehead
                        </p>

                        <p>Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
                            Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
                            Didn't make sense not to live for fun
                            Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
                            So much to do, so much to see
                            So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
                            You'll never know if you don't go
                            You'll never shine if you don't glow                            
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
